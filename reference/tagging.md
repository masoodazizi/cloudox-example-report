# Tagging Reference

Ownership, environment, and cost-allocation tag coverage. A missing tag is only reported where tag collection is known complete; collector-blind resource types are shown as Unknown (not collected).

_Displaying all **21** row(s) (no rows omitted)._

_Sorted most verified missing tags first, then resource type._

> Tags are not collected for this resource type, so tag presence/absence is unknown — not a verified gap.

**Coverage notes**

- Tag collection is not available for some resource types (AWS::ECS::Service, AWS::ElasticLoadBalancingV2::LoadBalancer, AWS::Lambda::Function); their rows show Environment/Owner/Cost Center as Unknown (not collected), NOT as verified missing tags. A missing tag is only asserted where tag collection is known to be complete.
- 'Cost Center' aggregates several cost-allocation tag keys (costcenter, cost-center, cost_center, billingcode, project); a value may come from any of them, so the column reflects cost-allocation coverage rather than a literal 'CostCenter' tag.
