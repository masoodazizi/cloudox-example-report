# Public Exposure Reference

Resources with a discovered public path, split into CONFIRMED exposure (public endpoint, internet-facing load balancer, public IP, or public-subnet route context) and EXPOSURE CANDIDATES (open security-group ingress only — permissive configuration, not proven internet reachability).

_Displaying all **9** row(s) (no rows omitted)._

_Sorted confirmed exposures first, then account, then resource._

| Account | Region | Resource | Resource Type | Exposure Type | Assessment | Evidence / Notes | Confidence | Evidence |

| 105769365151 | eu-central-1 | cloudox-demo-atlas-dev-sg-ecs (sg-0d6a48061beb72eae) | AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup | Open ingress configuration | Exposure candidate (config only) | Security group cloudox-demo-atlas-dev-sg-ecs has ingress rules allowing 0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0. | Assumed | `internet`, `sg-0d6a48061beb72eae` |
| 122122642149 | eu-central-1 | cloudox-demo-atlas-prod-sg-alb (sg-06f2b4190bf01d261) | AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup | Open ingress configuration | Exposure candidate (config only) | Security group cloudox-demo-atlas-prod-sg-alb has ingress rules allowing 0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0. | Assumed | `internet`, `sg-06f2b4190bf01d261` |

> Open security-group ingress (0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0) only — NOT proven internet-reachable. The SG's attachment, the resource's public addressing, an Internet Gateway route, NACLs, and a listening service are not all evidenced here. Treat as an exposure candidate to verify.

**Coverage notes**

- Confirmed vs candidate: a CANDIDATE row is an open security-group ingress rule only. It does NOT prove the SG is attached, that the resource has a public address, that an Internet Gateway route exists, that NACLs permit the path, or that a service is listening. Verify the full path before treating a candidate as reachable.
- Exact entry-point port/protocol is not modelled on exposure edges; see the Security Flow Reference for open ingress ports.
